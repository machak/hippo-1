    - Internet explorer is no longer supported

      Internet Explorer is now being phased out by Microsoft. As a result, NHS Digital
      no longer supports any version of Internet Explorer for our web-based products,
      as it involves considerable extra effort and expense, which cannot be justified
      from public funds. Some features on this site will not work. You should use
      a modern browser such as Edge, Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. If you have difficulty
      installing or accessing a different browser, contact your IT support team.
